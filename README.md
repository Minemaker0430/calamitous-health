# Calamitous Health
A lightweight Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that overhauls the regeneration system.

This is my first Minecraft mod EVER, so I'd appreciate some feedback/help if an issue pops up.

## Features:
- Removes hunger-based regen in favor of time-scaled natural regeneration.
- Adds temporary Armor penalties (affected by Armor Toughness) on Normal+ for taking damage, discouraging you from tanking hits.

**Most aspects of the mod can be changed through the config file.**
